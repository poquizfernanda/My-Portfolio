        <img src="img/WIFI.png">
        <p>Most of my time, I like to spend it on surfing in facebook and upload a picture for my day, scroll scroll and share the memes that makes me laugh. Second is uploading a beautiful picture in my instagram that I took and I love to heart the pictures of my followers. Third, I like to make a tweet in my twitter account, express my pain and loneliness and lastly I like to watch a trending videos in youtube.</p>
        <h4>Socializing</h4>
        <img src="img/social.png">
        <p>I write it to my skills because I ask one of my friend what he think is my skills and he said it is socializing. Well, I really want to make idle chatter with others to lessen my shy personality.</p>
        <h4>One call away</h4>
        <img src="img/phone.png">
        <p>They said I'm one call away because whenever they need me I'm always there for them and give them advice that I mostly can't apply to myself.</p>
